## Win32APILibrary


</div>

### Description

This code provides a series of class objects to access some of the most common API routines. There as also some expansion to the standard API calls that i have written myself.

This is a work in progress and will change from time to time as i add more functionality to it, i plan to add full FTP and SMTP objects to the dll in the coming weeks.

If anyone can improve on the existing code then please feel free to do so, please also send me the updated code so that i can update this library and comment it with your changes.

Please also vote for this if you think it deserves a vote.

Thanks

AMMENDMENT:

Fixed bug in Zero memory function which caused a fatal exception error.

Added Network routines, MapNetworkDrive, DisconnectNetworkDrive.
 
### More Info
 
some knowledge of the Win32 API would be beneficial but is not essential, all you really need to know is how to compile the code into a DLL and then you can start using it.
